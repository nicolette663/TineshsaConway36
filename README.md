Tinesha Conway.  That's my name.

I have over 18+ years of practical experience performing routine clerical and administrative functions such as: drafting correspondence, scheduling appointments, organizing/maintaining paper and electronic files, or providing information to callers.

I have a Masters Degree in Organizational Leadership which has provided me with superior creative problem solving skills, analytic and conceptual abilities;

I have developed my communication and business skills through leadership roles with a company now closed called Impressions by Nicolette.

With my background in administration I am certainly comfortable and knowledgeable of computers, communicating with various entities and key organizations. Also, coordinating with staff and handling the needs and wants of clients. My computer and technical experience includes writing letters, data for acquisitions and databases.
